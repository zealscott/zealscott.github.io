I am a third-year graduate student in computer science at Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. [Yunjun Gao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/gaoyj_en).


I have been very fortunate to work with Prof. [Zhikun Zhang](http://zhangzhk.com/) at Stanford University <img src='./images/stanford_logo.svg' style="width: 4em;">, with Prof. [Christian S. Jensen](https://homes.cs.aau.dk/~csj/) at Aalborg University <img src='./images/aau_logo.svg' style="width: 4em;">,  with Prof. [Baihua Zheng](https://faculty.smu.edu.sg/profile/zheng-baihua-521) at Singapore Management University <img src='./images/smu_logo.svg' style="width: 3.5em;">, with Dr. [Jianxun Lian](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jialia) and Dr. [Xing Xie](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xingx/) at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/) <img src='./images/microsoft_logo.svg' style="width: 4em;">.


My goal is to build reliable models with a focus on their explainability (to facilitate human understanding), data privacy (to preserve users' privacy), and robustness (to data noise), which guarantee their trustworthiness in critical real-world applications. I have published more than 10 papers at the top international conferences such as VLDB, KDD, SIGIR and ICDE.
